# odin-helpers

This is a small collection of code snippets for the [Odin programming language](https://github.com/gingerBill/Odin).

This is made by a very inexperience (when it comes to C) programmer, so there will be bugs!

In each of the folders in `tests` is a folder with the code and resources needed to test each helper. Go there for examples on how to use the procedures.

### Following is done:
 * md5.odin - Implementation of the MD5 hashing algorithm in pure Odin.
 * strhelpers.odin - String helper functions. indexOf and startsWith for now.

## My wishlist
 * Possibly other, newer hashing functions (that are not already in [hash.odin](https://github.com/gingerBill/Odin/blob/master/core/hash.odin)).
 * Reading files, line by line - not caring about Unix or Windows line endings.
